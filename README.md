# learningLatex
Hello World!

I am Sunakshi Tejwani an Eklavya Intern 2017, at IIT Bombay.

This repository consists of the step by step .tex files for learning latex language.

Latex is a language to create professional looking documents. Here the user takes care of the content only, and the remaning formatting is done by the language.
It is based on  WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) idea. One can take take of formatting easily without manualy setting the spacing between the text in Doc files like MIcrosoft Office and Libre Office Writer.
